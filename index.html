        <p>Hi I'm Basisah.</p>
        <p>I look different, because this is my soul.
        <p> My body is on the other side, with you all.</p>
        <p>I was much smaller when i was young. </p>
        <p>These are parts of other people I met over time.</p>
        <p>Some have left, but I have a bit of them with me, that’s why I’m here.</p>
        <p>I didn’t choose to keep them, they stayed. 
        <p>What I did have choice over was the people I met and learned from.</p>
        <p>That’s how I’m me. Hehe.</p>
