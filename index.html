        <p> The blob is an example of the last moments you have with someone. To emulate the feeling of seeing someone for the last time ever. We come across alot of people who we lose touch with after a while. Although they are alive, in our lives, their role is pretty much declared dead.</p>
        <p>When you do get the opportunity, you will realise that it is never not enough. You will always fall short of a little bit. You will feel that way.</p>
        <p>In your heart it will always be less than what you want to confess to them, but you will realise, it is the universe's way of telling you that it is enough.</p>
        <p>It is enough. Perhaps it is the universe's way of keeping your heart and theirs. Strong enough till you meet again in another time.</p>

        <p>Hi I'm blob.</p>
        <p>I look different, but i looked like you a long time ago.</p>
        <p>When I was younger, I was much smaller.</p>
        <p>These are parts of other people I met over time.</p>
        <p>Some of them moved on, but these are some of their parts that makes me.</p>
        <p>I didn’t have the choice to meet them.</p>
        <p>They just happened to come and happened to go.</p>
        <p>But I admired some of the things they did or how they thought.</p>
        <p>That’s how I’m me.</p>
        <p>Hehe.</p>
