        <p>Hi I'm blob.</p>
        <p>I look different, but i looked like you a long time ago.</p>
        <p>When I was younger, I was much smaller.</p>
        <p>These are parts of other people I met over time.</p>
        <p>Some of them moved on, but these are some of their parts that makes me.</p>
        <p>I didn’t have the choice to meet them.</p>
        <p>They just happened to come and happened to go.</p>
        <p>But I admired some of the things they did or how they thought.</p>
        <p>That’s how I’m me.</p>
        <p>Hehe.</p>
